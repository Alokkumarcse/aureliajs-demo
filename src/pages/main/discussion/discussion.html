      In this tab we are using canDeactivate() method to prevent away from the
      current screen such as if there's input from user that has not been saved.

      We may need to prompt the user, ask them if they want to save that or if
      they want to cancel the navigation altogether.
      <br />
      we can do these things with the canDeactivate() method.
