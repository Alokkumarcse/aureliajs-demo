  <h3>Discussion Page</h3>
  <p>${discussion}</p>
  <p>
    In this tab we are using canDeactivate() method to prevent away from the
    current screen such as if there's input from user that has not been saved.
    <br />
    We may need to prompt the user, ask them if they want to save that or if
    they want to cancel the navigation altogether.
    <br />
    we can do these things with the canDeactivate method.
  </p>

  <br />
  Discussion Input:
  <input type="text" value.bind="discussionInput" />
  <button type="button" click.delegate="save()">Save</button>
  <br />
  <br />
  Test the canDeactivate() and deactivate() method.
